                <h1>NETWORK MODELS</h1>
                <p>
                    Network models provide a structured framework for understanding and designing computer networks. They define the layers, protocols, and functions involved in the communication process between network devices. Here are some key points to note about network models:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Layered Structure: Network models are organized into layers, with each layer responsible for specific tasks. Layers provide a modular approach to network design and allow for easier troubleshooting and interoperability between different network devices and technologies.</li>
                    <li>Protocol Stacks: Network models utilize protocol stacks, which are sets of protocols implemented at each layer. These protocols govern how data is formatted, transmitted, and received across the network.</li>
                    <li>Abstraction: Network models provide a level of abstraction, separating the complex networking processes into manageable and understandable components. Each layer builds upon the services provided by the layer below it, hiding the implementation details from higher layers.</li>
                    <li>Standardization: Network models promote standardization by defining common protocols and interfaces. This standardization ensures compatibility and interoperability between different vendors' network devices and facilitates communication across networks.</li>
                    <li>Common Network Models: The two most widely used network models are the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model. The OSI model consists of seven layers, while the TCP/IP model comprises four layers. Both models provide a framework for understanding network communication but differ in their specific layer definitions and protocols.</li>
                </ol>

                <ol start="6">
                    <li>Flexibility: Network models provide flexibility in network design and allow for the integration of new technologies and protocols as they emerge. They serve as a foundation for scalable and adaptable network architectures.</li>
                    <li>Reference Points: Network models serve as reference points for network engineers, administrators, and developers. They help in troubleshooting network issues, understanding network protocols, and designing efficient and reliable network infrastructures.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Understanding network models is crucial for networking professionals as it provides a common language and framework for discussing and analyzing network architectures. It enables effective communication and collaboration in network planning, implementation, and maintenance.
